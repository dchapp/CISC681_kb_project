## University of Delaware CISC-481/681 Knowledge Base Project
This project contains our team's implementation of three inference algorithms and infrastructure for applying them to a knowledge base of *facts* and *rules*.

## Inference Algorithms
..1. Resolution
..2. Forward Chaining
..3. ??? (either backward chaining or DPLL)

## Dependencies
