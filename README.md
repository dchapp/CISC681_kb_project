## University of Delaware CISC-481/681 Knowledge Base Project
This project contains our team's implementation of three inference algorithms and infrastructure for applying them to a knowledge base of *facts* and *rules*.

### Inference Algorithms
1. Resolution
2. Forward Chaining
3. Backward Chaining

### Dependencies
The SymPy module is required, and is dependent upon:

1. Python 2.6 or higher
2. Mpmath, a Python module for arbitrary-precision arithmetic

SymPy can be installed via pip, as can Mpmath, or via your Linux distribution's package manager. More detailed instructions can be found at:

1. http://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html (If your version of SymPy is 0.7.7 or lower, mpmath is included.)
2. http://mpmath.org/

### Usage
A description of how to use the knowledge system, both in batch and interactive mode.
